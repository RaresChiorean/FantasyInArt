This was my first project as a FrontEnd Developer.
In this project i have used HTML/CSS, including Bootstrap.
Many parts of this project have placeholder text, because it was an exercise for the course I am taking to aquire my diploma.


As i said, this was my first project evere created, from which i continued to lear JavaScript, meaning that soon i will upload my diploma project where i worked a lot with JS
